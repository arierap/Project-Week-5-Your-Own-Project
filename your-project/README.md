## Project Description
The paper centers around the analysis the popular tv show 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S' over its ten seasons between 1994 and 2004.

I was and still am a huge 'friends' fan throughout its ten year run. I have probably seen all ten season more than 15 times through return episodes.

The idea was to analyse all 236 episodes by acquiring their associated transcripts and, with the power of python, be able to transform these transcripts into an actionable data set and answer some of the questions that have been on mind for over a decade.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions that sparked this paper span a combination of questions from finding out who had the most lines to how many times Joey said 'Hey, how you doin!'.

Some of the questions presented:

How many lines did each character directly contribute over 10 seasons
How many words did each character directly contribute over 10 seasons
Where did they spend most of their on screen time
How many times Joey said 'Hey, how you doin!'
How many times they say 'WE WERE ON A BREAK!'
How many times anyone said 'OH MY GOD!'
How many times 'dinosaur, palaeontology or palaeontologist' was said
How many times 'Smelly Cat'
How many times Joey mentions pizza
